                Conversation with Immigration Attorney Karen
              </h1>

              <p>
                In a recent podcast episode, we had the privilege of speaking
                with Karen, an experienced immigration attorney and founder of
                Elevation Law in Colorado. What began as a lighthearted exchange
                about podcast backdrops quickly turned into a powerful and
                eye-opening conversation about the realities of U.S. immigration
                law, common misconceptions, and the frightening consequences of
                misinformation.

                The Biggest Immigration Myth
              </h2>
              <p>
                Karen tackled one of the most persistent myths: that immigrants
                can simply &quot;get in line&quot; and fix their status. In
                reality, immigration laws are highly complex. &quot;It&apos;s
                not as easy as just paying a fee and filing a form,&quot; Karen
                explained. Many people, even without criminal records, face
                insurmountable legal barriers—despite contributing to their
                communities and paying taxes.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
                The Cost of Desperation
              </h2>
              <p>
                Karen shared stories of immigrants paying coyotes up to $50,000
                to cross the border—money that could&apos;ve been used for legal
                pathways if they existed. Unfortunately, the system isn&apos;t
                just expensive; it&apos;s often unavailable to those who need it
                most. &quot;People think it&apos;s a choice,&quot; Karen said,
                &quot;but many don&apos;t have legal options.&quot;
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
                The Dangers of Notarios and Fraud
              </h2>
              <p>
                Another danger lies in misinformation and bad actors.
                Non-lawyers posing as immigration experts—often called
                &quot;notarios&quot;—mislead families, costing them thousands
                and jeopardizing their legal standing. Karen emphasized the
                importance of working with a licensed immigration attorney who
                specializes in the field.
              </p>

                ICE Raids and Citizens Getting Deported
              </h2>
              <p>
                One of the more alarming parts of our conversation was
                Karen&apos;s confirmation that even U.S. citizens have been
                wrongly deported in recent years. This typically happens when
                someone doesn&apos;t have documentation on hand or their
                citizenship is challenged despite being valid. &quot;It&apos;s
                rare but very real,&quot; Karen said. She recommends always
                having at least a digital copy of your U.S. passport or birth
                certificate.

                Despite the challenges, Karen remains hopeful. &quot;The

                in our offices every day.&quot; But she&apos;s quick to add that
                the obstacles immigrants face today are harsher and more
                bureaucratic than ever before.

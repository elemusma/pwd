                How Attorneys Actually Find Expert Witnesses
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                First off, I asked Logan how he usually finds the experts he
                works with. His answer? Referrals. &quot;As a plaintiff&apos;s
                personal injury attorney, I have access to other attorneys. We
                often use similar experts,&quot; he said. He mainly relies on
                trusted colleagues who&apos;ve worked with certain experts
                before. Treating physicians are commonly used, but when he needs
                someone outside his network, he&apos;ll ask around or turn to
                vendors that specialize in expert witnesses.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Practical Experience</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                &quot;If you&apos;re an orthopedic surgeon, actually being a
                surgeon in the past matters,&quot; Logan explained.

              <p className="mb-4">

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Reputation</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Your reputation can be used against you. If you&apos;ve been
                disqualified from testifying, attorneys want to know why.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Diversity in Cases</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                He likes to see experts who&apos;ve worked both plaintiff and
                defense sides, or at least don&apos;t lean too heavily on one.

                Avoiding Mistakes That Can Hurt Your Career
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                I asked if disqualifications could ruin an expert&apos;s career.
                Logan said, &quot;It&apos;s not a fatal flaw, but it&apos;s
                definitely not a selling point. You want to avoid having to
                explain why you were disqualified.&quot;
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                He also warned against trying to be a &quot;Swiss army
                knife&quot; of experts. Stick to what you know. &quot;If
                you&apos;re selling yourself on something you&apos;re not,
                you&apos;re exposed,&quot; he said.

                The Role of Marketing (and the Risks)
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                We got into how{" "}
                <Link href="https://www.precisewolf.com/articles/marketing-strategies">
                  marketing can help

                or hurt an expert witness. Logan emphasized that marketing is
                fine—but it has to be done right. &quot;I&apos;ve seen brochures
                used against treating physicians,&quot; he said. Most of the
                time, it&apos;s used to question the relationship between the
                expert and the attorney—suggesting bias or some sort of
                collusion.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                He also warned about online content: &quot;The internet never
                forgets... be careful what you put out.&quot;
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Still, he believes it&apos;s important to have a website or a{" "}

                . &quot;You want to look like you&apos;re up with the
                times,&quot; he said. Just make sure you&apos;re reviewing
                everything that goes live.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
                No Website? That Could Hurt You Too
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Logan mentioned that while he wouldn&apos;t base his decision on
                a website alone, having a{" "}
                <Link href="/practice-areas/web-design">
                  modern, professional-looking website
                </Link>{" "}
                helps. &quot;If the website looks like it&apos;s from the 2000s,
                I might wonder if they&apos;re even practicing anymore,&quot; he
                said. It won&apos;t be a dealbreaker, but it could raise doubts.

                What if you&apos;re just getting started or having trouble
                getting hired? &quot;Go show why you&apos;re an expert,&quot;
                Logan advised. &quot;Put on a seminar, talk to people, and
                demonstrate your knowledge.&quot;
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Fancy marketing isn&apos;t the key—experience and credibility
                are. He encourages experts to lean on what makes them qualified,

                How Plaintiff Litigation Attorneys Evaluate Expert Witnesses
              </h1>

              <p className="mb-4">
                In this conversation with St. Louis personal injury attorney
                Patrick Hinrichs from Bruning Law Firm, we discussed what
                attorneys actually look for when hiring expert witnesses, how{" "}
                <Link href="https://www.precisewolf.com/practice-areas/web-design">

                and credibility impact hiring decisions, and the critical
                mistakes experts make by limiting their network. Patrick handles
                cases across automobile crashes, truck crashes, motorcycle
                accidents, and product liability matters, and he shares insider
                perspective on exactly what attorneys want from the experts they
                hire. This episode covers the real strategies attorneys use to
                evaluate credibility, the patterns they recognize that signal
                bias, and what can make or break an expert&apos;s reputation in
                the courtroom.

                The Hidden Cost of Not Marketing: Why Network Limitation
                Destroys Your Practice
              </h2>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Tadeo:</strong> I know a lot of experts tell me they
                don&apos;t need marketing because they already work with a
                handful of lawyers. They have steady business, they know these
                attorneys well, and they don&apos;t see why they need to expand.
                But from my perspective, it seems like that might actually be
                hurting them in the long run. What are your thoughts on that?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> That&apos;s a great point, and
                honestly, I think experts who say that are making a critical
                mistake. When you work with the same people over and over again,
                sure, you may have a steady flow of business in the short term.
                But you&apos;re fundamentally limiting the network of
                individuals that you&apos;re making yourself available to.
                You&apos;re potentially pigeon-holing yourself as an expert
                who&apos;s only going to be used by those particular law firms
                or companies.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                And here&apos;s what happens next: as you&apos;re used more and
                more by the same attorneys, your opinions become less and less
                credible. And I&apos;m not just talking about credibility with
                other attorneys. The court system sees this too. Judges who
                oversee lots of these types of cases get to know who you are and
                who you routinely represent. That&apos;s going to be reflected
                directly in the value they place in your opinion. I&apos;ve seen
                opinions written where judges explicitly criticize experts for
                their opinions and find them not credible just because of the
                sheer volume of opinions they provide and the fact that
                it&apos;s consistently for the same core group of defense
                counsel or defendant companies.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                So what happens is, when the companies and defense counsel
                realize that your opinion isn&apos;t worth what it used to be,
                that judges aren&apos;t giving your testimony the same weight,
                they stop using you as much. At that point, you&apos;re not
                getting the steady flow of business that you used to have
                because you&apos;ve been overused and you haven&apos;t worked on
                expanding your network. Then you&apos;re left with an inability
                to generate new business because you haven&apos;t taken the time
                to try to expand. You&apos;re essentially stuck.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Tadeo:</strong> So it sounds like experts are actually
                creating a trap for themselves by not marketing and not
                expanding. They think they&apos;re being efficient by keeping
                the business concentrated, but eventually that concentration
                becomes a liability?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> Exactly. It&apos;s counterintuitive,
                but yes. By limiting your network, you&apos;re actually creating
                long-term instability. You think you have security because you
                have steady work, but that security is an illusion. The moment
                those attorneys realize your opinions aren&apos;t as valuable as
                they once were, that steady stream dries up. And at that point,
                you haven&apos;t built the broader network that would allow you
                to pivot and find new business. You&apos;re left scrambling.

                When Overuse Kills Credibility: How Courts Recognize and Punish
                Bias
              </h2>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Tadeo:</strong> You mentioned that judges see these
                patterns. Can you walk me through what happens when a judge
                notices that an expert is being used repeatedly by the same side
                or the same defendant? What does that actually look like in a
                courtroom?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> Sure. When we&apos;re looking at
                experts for cases, we request trial testimony lists or trial
                disclosures to get an idea of how often they&apos;re named as an
                expert in federal cases or state cases. This is standard
                practice. What we&apos;ve discovered is that there are insurance
                companies that literally have an &quot;approved expert
                list&quot; internally that they rely on when deciding which
                experts they&apos;re going to use.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                So if you see an expert who is used by a defendant more than a
                handful of times over a several year period, that&apos;s kind of
                an indicator that you understand what their opinion is going to
                be before they even provide you with their report. When you see
                an expert used on 25% of the cases that you&apos;re filing on
                and they routinely provide a defense-based opinion, that&apos;s
                a big red flag for me. That tells me this person has a financial
                incentive to testify for one side.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Now, when you get to trial, we&apos;ve developed plenty of ways
                to really attack and discredit experts in that particular
                instance. We can cross-examine them about the frequency with
                which they testify for defendants versus plaintiffs. We can show
                the jury the pattern. We can point out that this expert makes
                money testifying for insurance companies, which means they have
                an incentive to downplay injuries or liability.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                And here&apos;s the thing: judges are watching this too. Judges
                who hear cases regularly are going to notice when the same
                expert shows up over and over again saying the same thing for
                the same type of party. Judges will explicitly note in their
                opinions that they&apos;re giving less weight to an
                expert&apos;s testimony because of this pattern. Once a pattern
                like that is established, that expert&apos;s value in the
                marketplace drops significantly.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Tadeo:</strong> So the pattern becomes a matter of
                public record at that point? Attorneys and judges can just look
                it up?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> Yes, absolutely. We can research
                expert testimony disclosures. We can see what cases they&apos;ve
                testified in. We can review depositions and trial testimony. All
                of that information becomes available through discovery and
                public records. So once you see that pattern, you can predict
                what that expert is going to testify to. That&apos;s not good
                for the expert, and it&apos;s not good for the attorneys that
                keep using them because eventually the courts lose faith in that
                expert&apos;s opinions.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                I&apos;ve seen situations where if you see an expert used on 25%
                of the cases, there&apos;s an understanding that they&apos;re
                probably not going to look at the merits of the case
                objectively. Once attorneys realize that, we develop strategies
                to attack their credibility. That&apos;s when the phone stops
                ringing, ironically, for the very people who kept using them.

                What Attorneys Really Want on Expert CVs and Resumes
              </h2>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Tadeo:</strong> Let me shift gears here. I see a lot of
                experts who focus heavily on their resume or CV. They make these
                documents really comprehensive, sometimes 10 pages long or more.
                They include all their training, all their publications, all
                their certifications. But when you&apos;re looking for a new
                expert outside your network, would you prefer to see a more
                summarized, condensed CV? Or do you actually want all of that
                information available right away when you&apos;re evaluating
                someone?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> That&apos;s a great question because
                it gets at what attorneys actually need versus what experts
                think they need to show. I&apos;ve seen those massive resumes
                where experts include their fellowship training, their residence
                training, all their research and published articles. I
                understand why they do that, that information is good for
                clearing the necessary hurdles to get someone admitted as an
                expert. If there&apos;s a challenge on their admissibility as an
                expert witness, you need all that foundational stuff.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                But as an attorney hiring an expert, I&apos;m focused on
                something quite different. What I really need to know is: who do
                you routinely testify for? What type of testimony experience do
                you have? What deposition experience do you have? Are you
                comfortable being aggressive with opposing counsel? Can you
                articulate complex concepts in a way that a jury can understand?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                I need to know that not only are you able to provide the opinion
                that I need, but also how you can articulate that opinion in a
                manner that helps me get my client the outcome we&apos;re
                looking for and the story that we&apos;re trying to tell. An
                expert can be extremely qualified on paper, but if they
                can&apos;t communicate effectively, if they seem uncertain or
                evasive under cross-examination, then they&apos;re not going to
                be as valuable to me.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Training is important, obviously. Any particular types of
                certifications that you might have are certainly important
                because if you have a more nuanced case and you need a
                particular expert that works in maybe a niche field, then you
                want to make sure that they have the qualifications to provide
                you with the opinion that you want. But beyond that, here&apos;s
                what I really want to see:
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                I want to see notable cases where you have testified, maybe a
                brief synopsis of the opinion that you provided. This allows me
                to see the particular type of opinion you rendered, who you
                rendered it for, and maybe even what the outcome of that case
                was. That tells me whether your opinion was a driver in the
                result of that case, and it helps me understand the types of
                cases you handle.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Tadeo:</strong> So when you say the outcome of the case,
                you don&apos;t necessarily care whether they helped win or lose,
                right? It&apos;s more about understanding the context?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> Well, that would tell me whether or
                not their opinion was a driver in the result of that case. There
                are a lot of things that go into whether a particular side wins
                a case or not, and it&apos;s unfair to whittle it down to just
                the experts. But yes, just knowing the overall results of that
                case and trying to get an understanding of the facts of that
                case and really what the focus of their particular opinion was
                in that case, that&apos;s going to let me know whether maybe the
                facts of that case and their opinion aligns with what I need an
                explanation for.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                So if I&apos;m looking at an expert who specializes in medical
                causation in car accidents, I want to see that they have
                experience testifying in car accident cases with medical injury
                claims. I don&apos;t just want to know they have a medical
                degree. I want to know they&apos;ve actually testified in
                relevant cases. That&apos;s what will help me make the decision
                about whether to hire them.

                Video: The Missing Piece on Expert Websites
              </h2>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Tadeo:</strong> This is something you mentioned earlier
                that I thought was really important, video. You talked about
                wanting to see video of experts introducing themselves or
                explaining their work. Can you expand on why that matters to you
                as an attorney? Because I don&apos;t think a lot of experts are
                doing this yet.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> Something that would be very
                beneficial to me is having some sort of video on your website,
                maybe a highlight video or just a basic video introducing
                yourself. As an attorney{" "}
                <Link href="https://www.precisewolf.com/articles/marketing-strategies">
                  marketing for an expert
                </Link>
                , having this content allows me to see you, listen to you, and
                get an idea for how I think a jury might respond to you. That
                would be very beneficial to me when I&apos;m deciding whether to
                hire you.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Here&apos;s the thing: it&apos;s not just about credentials
                anymore. I can read credentials on a resume. What I need to
                understand is how you present yourself. What&apos;s your
                communication style like? Are you clear when you explain things?
                Do you come across as confident without being arrogant? Can you
                answer difficult questions without getting defensive? If I
                can&apos;t get a sense of that from your website, I&apos;m
                missing critical information about whether you&apos;re the right
                fit for my case.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                When a jury sees you testify, your communication style, your
                demeanor, how you handle questions under pressure, all of that
                matters tremendously. If I can get a preview of that through
                video, that helps me make a much better decision about hiring
                you. It also helps me prepare my case better. If I can see how
                you explain things, I know how to frame my questions and what to
                expect in court.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                And honestly, as a consumer looking for an expert, I want to see
                who I&apos;m dealing with. I want to know what you look like,
                how you communicate. That&apos;s just basic due diligence. Most
                attorneys looking outside their network don&apos;t know you
                personally. They&apos;re evaluating you based on your website,
                your credentials, and increasingly, what you look like and how
                you present yourself. Video gives them that window.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Tadeo:</strong> So if an expert doesn&apos;t have video
                on their website, is that a reason not to hire them?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> It&apos;s not a dealbreaker by itself,
                but it&apos;s definitely a disadvantage. If I have two experts
                to choose from and one has video and one doesn&apos;t, I&apos;m
                going to lean toward the one with video. It gives me confidence
                that they&apos;re tech-savvy, professional, and willing to
                invest in how they present themselves. The expert without video
                is going to have to make up for that with other strong
                qualifications or referrals I trust.

                Professional Website Design as a First Impression
              </h2>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Tadeo:</strong> Let&apos;s talk about website design. I
                work with a lot of experts, and I&apos;m always telling them
                that the professionalism of their website actually impacts
                whether attorneys will hire them. Some experts resist this. They
                say, &quot;My work should speak for itself,&quot; or they
                don&apos;t want to spend the money. But do you think the
                professionalism of a website actually impacts your decision to
                hire an expert? Is it just a nice-to-have, or is it actually
                important?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> I definitely think that as a consumer,
                you&apos;re typically drawn more towards companies or experts
                that have a more well-put-together website. An older webpage
                that doesn&apos;t flow well, with some links that don&apos;t
                even work, or that just generally looks a little older, is
                definitely a turnoff for a younger attorney like myself.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                We want to make sure that the experts we hire are well-versed in
                appropriate forms of technology that we feel comfortable with.
                We want them to be responsive to all our inquiries in a timely
                fashion. If I&apos;m looking at an expert&apos;s website and it
                looks like it was built in 2005, I start wondering: Are they
                going to respond to my emails quickly? Will they be able to
                navigate discovery documents I send them? Can they handle
                depositions on Zoom if needed?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                When you encounter an older-appearing website, there are
                definitely some concerns. Given what juries expect to be
                presented with and what we&apos;re going to need in terms of
                professionalism and responsiveness, there&apos;s a moment where
                you&apos;re a little hesitant to hire someone who maybe
                doesn&apos;t have as advanced a website as a competitor.
                I&apos;m not saying you need the fanciest website in the world,
                but it needs to function properly and look current. It needs to
                reflect that you take your business seriously.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Tadeo:</strong> So it&apos;s less about aesthetic flash
                and more about functionality and modernity?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> Exactly. I don&apos;t need fancy. I
                need functional and current. If your website is from 20 years
                ago, it&apos;s going to make me wonder about a lot of things.
                And that&apos;s not fair to you as an expert, but it&apos;s
                human nature. We make judgments based on what we see. Your
                website is often the first impression an attorney will have of
                you.

                Why Modern Professional Websites Matter: Being Discoverable
              </h2>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Tadeo:</strong> Some experts have websites that
                genuinely look like they were built in 2000. I&apos;ve had them
                tell me, &quot;I don&apos;t need a website. Lawyers know who I
                am. They can find me through word of mouth.&quot; But my
                observation is that professionalism and looking modern actually
                does matter. If you have two experts, one with a really
                old-school website that&apos;s hard to navigate, and another
                with a really professional one that&apos;s easy to navigate and
                has nothing that could be used against them, would that weigh
                into your decision? How much does it matter?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> It&apos;s very easy to create a
                professional website if you have the right people doing it. If
                somebody has a website from 20 years ago, I wonder why
                they&apos;re having that website from 20 years ago. It&apos;s
                not really that difficult to update. You hire the right people,
                they make you a website, and I believe it helps you rank higher
                in different algorithms. This matters because most attorneys who
                have a case that maybe they&apos;re handling for the first time
                don&apos;t know where to begin looking for experts.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                So they&apos;re going to go online to try to find an expert who
                they feel best fits their need for their particular case.
                That&apos;s where a professional website comes in. You need to
                be findable. You need to look credible. And frankly, if you
                don&apos;t have a professional website, some attorneys are going
                to assume you&apos;re not serious about your business or that
                you&apos;re not tech-savvy enough to work with.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                Let me give you context: as an attorney, I&apos;m looking
                outside my network all the time because I have cases that
                require experts I haven&apos;t worked with before. Maybe
                it&apos;s a specialized type of injury or a complex product
                liability issue. I go to Google and I search for experts in that
                area. If your website doesn&apos;t come up, or if it comes up
                but looks terrible, I move on. There are plenty of other options
                out there.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                The notion that you wouldn&apos;t update your website seems
                weird to me. Maybe you&apos;re so busy that you don&apos;t think
                you need to. But that seems like an old-fashioned way to think
                about it. If you don&apos;t have a professional website,
                you&apos;re losing business to competitors who do. It&apos;s
                that simple.
              </p>

                <strong>Tadeo:</strong> So it sounds like having a modern
                website isn&apos;t really optional if you want to be found by
                attorneys outside your existing network?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Patrick:</strong> It&apos;s not optional if you want to
                grow your business. Word of mouth is great, and it&apos;s
                valuable, but it&apos;s limited. Your existing network will only
                take you so far. At some point, you need to be discoverable to
                attorneys who don&apos;t know you yet. And the only way
                they&apos;re going to find you is online. So yes, a professional
                website is essential.

                Key Takeaways for Expert Witnesses
              </h2>

              <p className="mb-4">
                This conversation with Patrick highlighted several critical
                considerations for expert witnesses building and maintaining
                their practice:
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Diversify Your Network:</strong> Don&apos;t rely solely
                on a handful of referring attorneys. Marketing and building a
                broader network protects you from becoming overused. When you
                work with the same attorneys repeatedly, your opinions become
                predictable and your credibility suffers, not just with
                attorneys, but with judges and courts. The steady business you
                think you have is actually fragile and temporary.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Understand Pattern Recognition:</strong> Courts and
                attorneys track how often you testify and for whom. Judges
                actively review these patterns and factor them into how much
                weight they give your opinions. If you&apos;re being used 25% of
                the time by the same defendant or insurance company, that&apos;s
                a red flag that everyone will notice. Judges will even write
                this into their opinions, noting that they&apos;re giving less
                weight to your testimony because of the pattern.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Highlight Relevant Cases on Your CV:</strong> Beyond
                training and credentials, attorneys want to see notable cases
                where you testified and brief descriptions of your opinions.
                This helps them assess whether you&apos;re the right fit for
                their specific case and understand your track record and the
                types of cases you handle. Including case outcomes helps them
                understand the context of your work.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Add Video Content to Your Website:</strong> Include
                video introducing yourself on your website, even a simple
                introduction. Attorneys want to see how you present yourself and
                communicate because it directly impacts how a jury will perceive
                you. Your credibility depends not just on credentials, but on
                communication style, demeanor, and how you handle questions.
                Video gives attorneys a preview of all of that.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Invest in Professional Web Design:</strong> An outdated
                or poorly functioning website is a turnoff to attorneys looking
                outside their network. Professional design signals competence,
                technical proficiency, and that you take your business
                seriously. When attorneys are vetting unfamiliar experts, your
                website is often their first and deciding impression. It
                doesn&apos;t need to be fancy, but it needs to be current and
                functional.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Balance Your Client Base Strategically:</strong> Working
                with both plaintiffs and defendants can enhance credibility.
                However, be intentional about balance. Avoid becoming known as
                someone who always testifies for one side. If you appear biased
                toward defendants or plaintiffs, opposing counsel will attack
                that relentlessly during cross-examination. Attorneys will
                research your history and use patterns against you.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Include Photos on Your CV and Website:</strong> Have
                your photo on your website and your CV. Attorneys want to see
                who they&apos;re working with. However, be thoughtful about
                presentation, wear professional but modest clothing, avoid
                flashy jewelry or accessories that suggest excessive wealth.
                What experts wear and how they present themselves sends a
                message that juries will interpret.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Be Found Online:</strong> Attorneys searching outside
                their network are going online to find experts. If you&apos;re
                not discoverable through search, you&apos;re missing
                opportunities. A professional website isn&apos;t a luxury,
                it&apos;s essential for being considered by attorneys who
                don&apos;t know you personally. This is particularly important
                as attorneys handle new types of cases and need experts they
                haven&apos;t worked with before.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                <strong>Market Thoughtfully:</strong> Some marketing is
                necessary to build your practice. But be smart about it.
                Don&apos;t market exclusively to one side or one type of client.
                Don&apos;t use language that makes you sound like a hired gun.
                Position yourself as an expert in your field who helps attorneys
                understand complex issues, not as someone available to testify
                for anyone willing to pay.

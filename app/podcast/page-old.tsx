            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About the Podcast</h2>
            <h3>What&apos;s the purpose of this podcast?</h3>
            <p>
              The podcast is focused on educating expert witnesses by giving
              them direct insight into what attorneys actually look for when
              hiring an expert. It&apos;s all about improving expert-attorney
              collaboration through open, honest conversations.
            </p>

            <h3>Who is my audience?</h3>
            <p>
              My audience is made up of expert witnesses who are doctors,
              engineers, forensic professionals, and other specialists who want
              to work with more attorneys and better understand how to position
              themselves for legal work.
            </p>

            <h3>Why am I inviting attorneys to be guests?</h3>
            <p>
              Because attorneys know better than anyone what makes a strong
              expert witness. Your perspective is valuable and can help shape
              how experts show up in cases which benefits the entire legal
              process.
            </p>

            <h3>Is this podcast promotional or sales-related?</h3>
            <p>
              No. This isn&apos;t about me promoting my business. It&apos;s
              about providing education content for the experts and as a thank
              you giving you an opportunity to promote your law firm and get
              free exposure.
            </p>

            <h3>What kind of questions will be asked?</h3>
            <p>
              We&apos;ll ask about your experience working with expert
              witnesses, what makes one stand out, what red flags you look for,
              and how experts can improve their communication, reports, or
              testimony.
            </p>
            <h3>How long is the podcast episode?</h3>
            <p>
              Each episode will be 20 minutes. It&apos;s meant to be quick,
              focused, and easy to fit into your schedule.
            </p>
            <h3>Do I need to prepare anything?</h3>
            <p>
              No major prep is required. We&apos;ll send over a few suggested
              questions ahead of time so you feel ready. It&apos;s a relaxed,
              interview-style conversation.
            </p>
            <h3>Will I get to share my firm or contact info?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, we&apos;ll mention your name, firm, and include a link to
              your website in the episode description. Think of it as a small
              but meaningful way to give back to the legal community and gain
              some organic exposure.
            </p>
            <h3>Where will the podcast be published?</h3>
            <p>
              Episodes will be published on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and on our
              website. We&apos;ll also share clips on LinkedIn and other
              platforms our expert audience follows.

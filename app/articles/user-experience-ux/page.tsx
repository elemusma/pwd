              Attorneys Decide Fast—Poor UX Gets You Dismissed
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Attorneys reviewing expert witnesses often move fast. They scan,
              evaluate, and make judgments within seconds. If your website loads
              slowly, looks outdated, or lacks clear contact paths, they might
              leave before reading your credentials. In legal markets, that can
              mean fewer inquiries, lower visibility, and missed cases. User
              experience, or UX, is the structure, flow, and clarity that makes
              a digital impression work—or fail.

              Why UX Is Often Overlooked by Expert Witnesses
            </h2>
            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Many expert witness websites function like static CVs. They often
              lack the usability features professionals in other industries take
              for granted. According to the{" "}
              <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/" target="_blank">
                Interaction Design Foundation
              </a>
              , user experience includes more than design aesthetics. It covers
              usability, clarity, accessibility, and trustworthiness. When those
              elements are weak, attorneys may question not only your online
              presentation but also your reliability as a litigation partner.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Peter Morville&apos;s UX Honeycomb identifies seven essential UX
              traits: usable, useful, findable, credible, desirable, accessible,
              and valuable. For expert witnesses, credibility and findability
              are non-negotiable. Even if your CV is technically accessible, an
              outdated or poorly styled website can signal low quality or
              inattention to detail—raising red flags for attorneys. If your
              practice areas aren&apos;t clearly described or your site fails on
              mobile, lawyers may assume you&apos;re behind the curve,
              regardless of your actual qualifications.

              A Real-World User Experience (UX) Breakdown of an Expert Witness

            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Picture this: A forensic engineering expert&apos;s website opens
              with their name in the page title and a headshot positioned on the
              right. On the left, there&apos;s a block of text with bullet
              points like &quot;Over 20 years of experience in...&quot;
              &quot;Licensed Professional...&quot; and &quot;XYZ
              Certified.&quot; While the credentials are solid, the layout feels
              dated—text may be misaligned, other elements spill off the screen
              on mobile, and there&apos;s no clear narrative guiding attorneys
              through what the expert actually does. Without defined case types,
              legal relevance, or direct contact links, the site may come across
              as low quality or unprofessional, even if the expert is highly
              qualified.

                attorneys scanning quickly

              , this layout creates friction. There&apos;s no immediate signal
              of what the expert does, which case types they serve, or how to
              contact them. Key information is often buried below the
              fold—forcing visitors to scroll or guess where to look. In some
              cases, valuable content like videos or testimonials is not placed
              above-the-fold so it doesn&apos;t to make a difference. If the
              first impression is poor, attorneys may never scroll far enough to
              see it.{" "}

            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
              A better UX would begin with a clear statement like
              &quot;Structural Engineering Expert Witness for Construction
              Disputes&quot; placed prominently at the top, along with visible,
              actionable contact options. Navigation should reflect legal
              interests—such as &quot;Qualifications,&quot; &quot;Case
              Types,&quot; and &quot;Testimony Experience&quot;—to match the way
              attorneys evaluate potential experts.

              Improving UX doesn&apos;t mean hiring a giant development firm. It
              means making design choices that align with how attorneys research
              and make decisions. Start by ensuring your site works on all
              devices. Responsive design isn&apos;t optional—legal professionals
              often search from mobile phones. Your navigation should be direct,
              using language attorneys use: &quot;Testimony History,&quot; not
              &quot;Highlights.&quot;

            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Organize your homepage to answer three questions immediately: Who
              are you? What kinds of cases do you take? How can a lawyer contact
              you now? Each internal page should be structured with headers,
              bullet points, and downloadable content that builds legal trust.

            A blog is a regularly updated section of a website that presents
            articles, or blog posts, on topics relevant to its audience. These

            reinforce digital credibility, and drive targeted visibility among

          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            Originally digital diaries in the mid-1990s, blogs evolved from
            personal narratives to institutional assets. By the early 2000s,
            businesses began using them for visibility, leveraging web
            publishing tools like Blogger and WordPress.

            reflections on cases (respecting confidentiality), educational

          <p className="mb-4 text-base text-gray-700">
            Word count depends on the topic. Most expert-targeted posts perform
            well in the 1,200–2,000 word range. Blog post format should follow a
            headline-intro-body-CTA pattern. The first known blog appeared in
            1994. Posting on your own site is best; syndicate to LinkedIn or
            Medium secondarily. Posting regularly supports SEO and ongoing
            visibility.

            The Multifaceted Impact of Mobile Responsiveness
          </h3>

          />
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Mobile responsiveness means more than shrinking content to fit. It
            means reorganizing layout, enlarging tap targets, and maintaining
            legibility without zooming. Sites that fail to meet this standard
            frustrate users and send negative usability signals to Google.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Unlike mobile-friendly designs that merely scale down desktop
            layouts, responsive websites restructure content based on screen
            size and orientation. This distinction matters when your credibility
            depends on clarity—especially when presenting detailed CVs,
            deposition history, or technical case examples.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
            For expert witnesses, a well-optimized mobile site can mean the
            difference between being found by a law firm and being passed over.
          </p>

            Building Expert Witness Sites That Convert on Mobile
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Precise Wolf Digital specializes in responsive design tailored to the
            legal expert market. Our process begins with using high-converting
            layouts, ensuring the core value propositions—credibility,
            specialization, experience—are prominent and accessible on phones
            and tablets.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
            We implement responsive CSS and media queries to control how content
            adjusts across screen sizes. Every layout decision is tested on
            physical devices to account for real-world behavior, not just
            emulators. That includes iPhones, Android devices, and tablets in
            both orientations.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Speed is another key factor. Mobile users won&apos;t wait for
            bloated pages to load. We optimize images, compress stylesheets, and
            follow Core Web Vitals benchmarks to keep your site fast and fluid.
            Tap targets are made finger-friendly, forms are simplified, and text
            is auto-scaled to remain readable without zooming.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
            One telecom engineer we worked with had a mobile-unfriendly site
            that loaded slowly and didn&apos;t have optimized web copy. After a
            responsive redesign and performance overhaul, their overall attorney
            engagement increased.

            Ranking Higher with Mobile-Responsive SEO Strategies
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Google uses mobile-first indexing to determine search rankings. If
            your expert witness site doesn&apos;t pass its mobile usability
            tests, you&apos;re less likely to appear when attorneys search for
            specialists in your field. This applies even if your desktop site is
            flawless. Which if your website is not mobile responsive, it
            probably doesn&apos;t look so well on desktop either.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
            We incorporate structured data, logical content hierarchy, and
            internal linking that adapts across screen sizes. This helps search
            engines understand your areas of expertise—whether it&apos;s
            accident reconstruction, medical causation, or wireless technology
            disputes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
            We also research and implement{" "}

            </a>
            &quot;, or &quot;electrical injury litigation expert&quot;.
            Responsive design ensures these terms are present and readable
            across all devices, without harming layout or performance.

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-4">
            By combining mobile-optimized content with technical SEO and clear

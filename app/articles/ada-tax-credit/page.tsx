            Implementing LocalBusiness Schema Markup for ADA Services
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
            LocalBusiness schema markup is a powerful tool for law firms and
            consulting services looking to increase local search visibility. By
            defining key business information such as address, contact details,
            and service offerings using structured data, firms can significantly
            enhance their search engine presence.

          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
            LocalBusiness schema is a specific subtype of the Organization
            schema, tailored to businesses with a physical location. For firms
            providing ADA compliance consultations, using schema markup helps
            communicate service offerings to search engines more effectively,
            resulting in rich snippets and knowledge panel features.

            Implementation Example
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
            JSON-LD schema markup for ADA consultation services can include
            fields such as “@type”: “LegalService,” “name”: “ADA Compliance

            increase visibility and client acquisition through ADA compliance
            services. By aligning SEO efforts with ADA guidelines, firms can not

            expertise in helping businesses leverage tax credits for
            accessibility improvements.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Why is web design important for expert witnesses?</h3>
        <p>
          A well-designed website establishes credibility, builds trust, and
          helps expert witnesses showcase their qualifications and expertise to
          attorneys. It ensures your content is easy to find, your services are
          clearly communicated, and your site appears professional and
          authoritative—key factors in getting more case inquiries.
        </p>
        <h3>Will web design be replaced by AI?</h3>
        <p>
          AI tools can assist with parts of the web design process, like layout
          suggestions or content generation. However, for expert witnesses, a
          strategic, human-centered approach is critical. Your website must
          reflect your professional reputation, comply with legal industry
          nuances, and convert attorney visitors—tasks that still require expert
          web designers.
        </p>
        <h3>Are web design and web development the same?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Web design focuses on the look, feel, and user experience of your
          site—layout, branding, and content structure. Web development brings
          those designs to life through coding and technical functionality. For
          expert witnesses, both are essential: design makes you look like the
          authority and expert in your field to lawyers, development ensures
          your website loads and works properly on every browser and that
          lawyers can reach out to you easily.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How does web design impact content marketing for expert witnesses?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Good web design enhances how your content is consumed. A clean,
          responsive layout makes it easy for attorneys to find your case
          studies, CV, news exposure and blog articles. Strategic design boosts
          engagement, supports SEO, and drives inquiries—helping your content
          marketing efforts actually convert.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What are web design principles, and why do they matter for expert
          witnesses?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Web design principles include clarity, simplicity, mobile
          responsiveness, accessibility, and visual hierarchy. For expert
          witnesses, these principles ensure your site is easy to navigate,
          visually trustworthy, and optimized to guide lawyers toward contacting
          you for their cases.
        </p>
